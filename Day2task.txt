Write a blog on difference between document and window object?
=> Each HTML document that gets loaded into a window becomes a document object.
=> The document contains the contents of the page. Using document object,
  JavaScript can modify, add and delete the HTML elements, attributes CSS
   styles in the page
=>The window object represents a window/tab containing a DOM document where as
  document object is property of window object that points to the DOM document
  loaded in that window.
=>The other major difference is that both window object and document object have properties and methods.
 Few method names are same in both objects but with different behavior.
  In the below example window.open() opens a new tab or window and document.open() creates a blank document within the window.

Codeketa practice? (i cant understand the question)
